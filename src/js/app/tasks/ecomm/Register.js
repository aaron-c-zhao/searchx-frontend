        <img  src='/img/experiment.png' width="50" style="margin-left: 20px;margin-bottom: 20px;"alt='participants'/>
        </br>
        In this study, you are tasked with searching for products in a collection of online products with fellow users. The experiment has four main parts:
            <ol type="-">
            <li><strong>Pre-questionnaire</strong>: we will ask about your experience searching the Web with other users before.</li>
            <li><strong>Waiting phase</strong>: you will wait for your fellow users that you signed up the experiment together with.</li>
            <li><strong>Collaborative product search phase</strong>: you and your fellow participants will be given two tasks work together on. </li>

            <li><strong>Post-questionnaire</strong>: we will ask about how was your overall experience with our experiment.
